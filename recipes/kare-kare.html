    <h3>About Kare-Kare</h3>
    <p>Kare Kare is a traditional Filipino stew complimented with a thick savory peanut sauce. 
        The commonly used meats for this dish are ox tail, tripe, and pork leg; on some occasions 
        goat and chicken meat are also used. Besides the peanuts, this dish depends on the shrimp 
        paste (on the side) in order to be fully enjoyed. Traditionally, “palayok” (clay cooking pot) 
        is used to cook this dish and it is also used as the serving pot.</p>
